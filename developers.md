Developing with Tecido Starter Kit
==================================

Start by forking the project. Actually, change the project and repo names (unless you are going to contribute to Tecido Starter Kit). After all, you are starting your own project. Clone your renamed fork and edit newproject.sh, changing the variable to suit your needs. Run it, push the changes to your repo, done.

Anyone will be able to follow the readme instructions and build your Drupal project.

Dependencies
============

The newproject.sh will need sed and rename. apt-get them.

You need, of course, Drush and Drush Make. See readme.md for instructions on those.
